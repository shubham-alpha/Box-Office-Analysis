It premiered at Loew's State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. The movie's reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur). This record-setting Oscars sweep has since been equaled by Titanic in 1998 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2004, but never broken.",14.319742999999999,/syPMBvvZsADTTRu3UKuxO1Wflq.jpg,12/26/59,212.0,Released,The entertainment experience of a lifetime.,Ben-Hur,"[{'id': 3035, 'name': 'roman'}, {'id': 3071, 'name': 'prince'}, {'id': 3339, 'name': 'chariot race'}, {'id': 3575, 'name': 'jerusalem'}, {'id': 5744, 'name': 'governor'}, {'id': 6078, 'name': 'politics'}, {'id': 6917, 'name': 'epic'}, {'id': 9713, 'name': 'friends'}, {'id': 9748, 'name': 'revenge'}, {'id': 11508, 'name': 'jewish'}, {'id': 154820, 'name': 'galley'}, {'id': 192491, 'name': 'galley slave'}]",146900000,0,0,4,Action Adventure Drama History,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20,6,31,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,3,23,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,4,6,12,4,3,4,2,6,2,0,0

Ilya is a character close to the ""hooker with a heart of gold"" clich√©. Homer feels Ilya's life style typifies the degradation of Greek classical culture and attempts to steer her onto the path of morality. It constitutes a variation of the Pygmalion story.  The film stars Melina Mercouri and Jules Dassin, and it gently submerges the viewer into Greek culture, including dance, music, and language (through the use of subtitles). The signature song and the bouzouki theme of the movie became hits of the 1960s and brought the composer, Manos Hadjidakis, an Academy Award.",1.879162,/iHXtTX8l9tfIqL7NsZ76Nfmj72r.jpg,5/24/60,91.0,Released,The Happy Street-Walker of Piraeus...,Never on Sunday,"[{'id': 549, 'name': 'prostitute'}, {'id': 1200, 'name': 'greece'}]",8000000,0,0,3,Comedy Drama Romance,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
